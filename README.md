# Operational Indicators Dashboard – Promigas (Internship Project)

This repository contains dashboards developed during my data analytics internship at **Promigas (Promisol)**.  
The project focused on monitoring and analyzing operational performance at the **CPF Bonga y Mamey Gas Treatment Plant**.

## Dashboards Overview
- **Main Menu** – entry point with plant selection (Gas Treatment, Power Generation, Photovoltaics).
- **Work Order Management** – KPIs on total orders, corrective vs. preventive, backlog, execution rate.
- **Maintenance Indicators** – Availability, Downtime, MTBF, MTTR, operational hours, and failure history.
- **Trend Analysis** – Utilization, operational hours, scheduled/unscheduled outages, and root causes of failures.
- **Power Generation** – KPIs on energy generated, sold, consumption, power factor, and turbine failures.
- **Steam Generation** – KPIs on steam produced, availability, efficiency, thermal power, and boiler failures.
- **Detailed Equipment History** – Drilldowns by compressor/turbine with MTBF, downtime, and failure records.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for dashboard development and visualization
- **SQL / Excel** as data sources
- **Python (ETL/cleaning)** for preprocessing (when required)

## Key Outcomes
- Automated monitoring of operational KPIs
- Improved visibility of gas treatment plant reliability
- Centralized reporting for maintenance and operations teams
